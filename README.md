* What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?
How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
* I learned what I should learn from design and the use of css html languages ​​to develop the design of the page. The time it took me is four hours, and the time I expect is half an hour, but I started the course late and I'm still like that, but soon I will finish what I missed because of technical malfunctions
